<h1>Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#code-of-conduct" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>All participants in the fsspec community are expected to adhere to a Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of
fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who
contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating
documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.</p>
<p>We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, treating everyone as unique humans deserving of
respect.</p>
<p>Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The use of sexualized language or imagery</p></li>
<li><p>Personal attacks</p></li>
<li><p>Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments</p></li>
<li><p>Public or private harassment</p></li>
<li><p>Publishing other’s private information, such as physical or electronic
addresses, without explicit permission</p></li>
<li><p>Other unethical or unprofessional conduct</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>
<p>By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves
to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of
managing this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce
the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.</p>
<p>This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.</p>
<p>If you feel the code of conduct has been violated, please report the
incident to the fsspec core team.</p>
<section id="reporting">
<h2>Reporting<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you believe someone is violating theCode of Conduct we ask that you report it
to the  Project by emailing <a class="reference external" href="mailto:community&#37;&#52;&#48;anaconda&#46;com">community<span>&#64;</span>anaconda<span>&#46;</span>com</a>. All reports will be kept
confidential. In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need
to be made. If that’s the case, the identities of all victims and reporters
will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.
If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law
enforcement first.</p>
<p>In your report please include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Your contact info</p></li>
<li><p>Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.
If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.</p></li>
<li><p>When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record
please include a link.</p></li>
<li><p>Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.</p></li>
<li><p>If you believe this incident is ongoing.</p></li>
<li><p>If you believe any member of the core team has a conflict of interest
in adjudicating the incident.</p></li>
<li><p>What, if any, corrective response you believe would be appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p>Any other information you believe we should have.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Core team members are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard
to the reporter and details of an incident.</p>
<section id="what-happens-next">
<h3>What happens next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-happens-next" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>You will receive an email acknowledging receipt of your complaint.
The core team will immediately meet to review the incident and determine:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What happened.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.</p></li>
<li><p>Who the bad actor was.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone’s
physical safety.</p></li>
<li><p>If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety,
the working groups’ immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If a member of the core team is one of the named parties, they will not be
included in any discussions, and will not be provided with any confidential
details from the reporter.</p>
<p>If anyone on the core team believes they have a conflict of interest in
adjudicating on a reported issue, they will inform the other core team
members, and exempt themselves from any discussion about the issue.
Following this declaration, they will not be provided with any confidential
details from the reporter.</p>
<p>Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will make a
decision as to how to response. Responses may include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).</p></li>
<li><p>A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved.</p></li>
<li><p>A public reprimand.</p></li>
<li><p>An imposed vacation</p></li>
<li><p>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all spaces (GitHub repositories, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>A request for a public or private apology.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a
resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.</p>
<p>Once we’ve determined our final action, we’ll contact the original reporter
to let them know what action (if any) we’ll be taking. We’ll take into account
feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we
don’t guarantee we’ll act on it.</p>
